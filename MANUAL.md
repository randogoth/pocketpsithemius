## Caution

* The device has three built in 385nm UV-A LEDs that are quite intense (120mW) and can be harmful to eyes and skin.
* Follow the instructions carefully!
* Do Not look directly into UV light. This can be harmful to the human body especially to the eyes and skin, even for brief period due to the intense UV light.
* If viewing the UV light is necessary, please use UV filtered glasses to avoid damage by the UV light.
* Avoid direct eye and skin exposure to the UV light.
* *KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF REACH*.

## Setup

Place the Psithemius in front of you with the word OPIENC and the small hexagram or "star of David" symbol ✡ in the triangle pointing away from you.

For magical operations it is advised to sit in front of the Psithemius facing East. For radionic operations it is advised to face North instead.

## Power

Your Pocket Psithemius comes with a 0.5m long USB-A to 5.5 mm/2.1 mm 5V DC Barrel Jack power cable. Plug the Barrel connector end of the cable into the Barrel socket at the rear end of the device and plug the USB-A end into a USB socket or 5V DC USB Power Adapter such as the one that came with your mobile phone. Alternatively you may also plug it into any portable USB Power Bank battery pack.

Power the device on by pulling the tiny switch at the rear lefthand side right next to the Barrel connector to the left.

## Button Functions

The device has three buttons: A on the left side of the triangle, B on the right side, and C in front of the triangle towards you. Please read what the buttons do. In the detailed sections below you will learn how to apply these functions properly.

### Button A

* Momentarily pressing button A turns an LED in the center of the triangle on.

* Subsequent presses of button A allow you to cycle through a selection of 9 colors that follow classic planetary correspondences and then turns the LED off again.

* Pressing and holding button A for more than a second and then releasing it activates a randomized display of colors in random frequencies. Pressing and holding button A again deactivates this mode again.

### Button B

* Momentarily pressing button B triggers a countdown of 5 second indicated by a blinking blue light. After the countdown is over the three UV-LEDs turn on and remain on for 60 seconds, then turn off.

* Any momentary press of button B while the UV-LEDs are on will immediately turn them off.

* Pressing and holding button B for more than a second triggers a countdown of 5 second indicated by a blinking blue light. The last blink is followed by 5 more rapid blinks. After the countdown is over the three UV-LEDs turn on and remain on. All buttons are deactivated in this mode. The device needs to be completely turned off in order to re-activate all buttons.

### Button C

* Momentarily pressing button C makes the LED blink green twice and turn an internal amplification circuit on. 

* A subsequent press of button C makes the LED blink red twice and turn the internal amplification circuit off.

## Modes of Operation

### Primary Modes

The Psithemius has been designed to provide functionality for different modes of operation. Its main function is to serve as a so-called [Trithemian Table of Practice](#i-trithemian-table-of-practice) with a "triangle of manifestation" for conjurations following the established protocol of such practice laid out in the so-called "Trithemian" tradition of "drawing spirits into crystals".

In addition the device incorporates electronic functions to improve this mode of use by enabling the operator to clear a quartz crystal before and after such operation and to [prime it with colors and resonance](#ii-crystal-programming) according to classic planetary correspondences.

### Secondary Modes

Due to the combination of functions built into the Psithemius it also allows for additional use cases:

* [Frequency Resonator](#i-frequency-resonator)
* [Amplified Radionic Transmitter](#ii-amplified-radionic-transmitter)
* [Fluid Condenser Mirror Charger](#iii-fluid-condenser-mirror-charger)
* [Wishing Machine / Sigil Activator](#iv-wishing-machine---sigil-activator)

## Detailed Primary Operations

### I. Trithemian Table of Practice

Unpowered, the Psithemius can be used as a portable classic Trithemian table of practice. The overall design is based on this magical tool. 

The circular "table" features two concentric circles with magical names and characters: 

The outer ring features the names of the seven planetary archangels Michael (Sun), Haniel (Venus), Raphael (Mercury), Gabriel (Moon), Qaphziel (Saturn), Sachiel (Jupiter), and Samael (Mars). The names are written in their original Hebrew spelling set in a magical typeface called "Celestial script" found in Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim's "Third Book of Occult Philosophy". Assuming the rear end of the device resembles the Eastern cardinal direction they are ordered around the circle following a logic of planetary correspondences.

The inner ring features the names of the four Elemental or Cardinal Kings Oriens (East), Paimon (West), Ariton (North), Amaimon (South), again according to their directions assuming the rear end of the device points East. For any kind of operation, position the Psithemius in a way that the Cardinal Kings names point into the correct cardinal directions.

In the center of the circles is a so-called "triangle of manifestation".

A precise descriptio of its design elements have been given by Frater Rufus Opus in some of his course material on the subject:

>The Table of Practice is a symbol of the cosmos. [...] The outermost circle represents the Seven Heavens and the Intelligences therein. They are the governors of the spheres, and their presence helps ensure you get the spirit you’re looking for when you perform your conjuration. The Elemental Kings provide the gate to the material realm, so the spirits can influence your life materially, if necessary, but they also make sure that any spirit you call up of a terrestrial nature won’t go ballistic and eat your soul, leaving you dead by dawn. These two circles together represent the meeting of the Heavens and the Earth in your temple space. [...] Taken altogether, the Table of Practice represents our relationship with the Seven Governors, the Four Elemental Kings, and the Process of Manifestation. It is designed to provide the place where a spirit can manifest, and to give us a shared space between the Heavens and the Earth in which we can work together to accomplish the things we have to do.

The Psithemius is a mere tool to be used in a ritual context of the pracice discussed here. A detailed manual for this system of conjuration exceeds the purpose of this manual by far. If you want to learn more on the subject, please consult [Frater Rufus Opus book "Seven Spheres"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23644473-seven-spheres) or dive into Polyphanes' extensive treatment of the subject in his [free ebook](http://digitalambler.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trithemius.pdf).

### II. Crystal Programming

Part of the work briefly touched in part I is the accumulation of materia magica resonating with the planetary forces of the transdimensional entities the operator wishes to conjure. Traditionally this is achieved by placing precious stones, metals, herbs, symbols, or other material onto the altar used for the operation, following the principle of like attracting alike. 

The Psithemius offers an innovative new way of enhancing this method by priming the quartz crystal that is usually placed into the center of the Triangle of Manifestation. Prior to a conjuration the operator can clear the crystal of all previously imprinted energetic patterns and then charge it with a set of resonances auspiciously adjusted to the desired planetary correspondences needed for the operation.

#### 1. Clearing the Crystal

1. Place the quartz crystal to be used in the operation into the center of the triangle

2. Momentarily press button B to start the countdown for the UV-LEDs to turn on.

3. While the countdown is running, move away from the device or put on some protective gear for your eyes and skin.

4. After the 5 second countdown, the UV-LEDs will turn on and immerse the crystal in strong ultraviolet light

*CAUTION:*

* The device has three built in 385nm UV-A LEDs that are quite intense (120mW) and can be harmful to eyes and skin.
* Follow the instructions carefully!
* Do Not look directly into UV light. This can be harmful to the human body especially to the eyes and skin, even for brief period due to the intense UV light.
* If viewing the UV light is necessary, please use UV filtered glasses to avoid damage by the UV light.
* Avoid direct eye and skin exposure to the UV light.
* *KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF REACH*.

5. After 60 seconds the UV-LEDs turn off and it is safe for you to operate the device again. The crystal should be cleared now.

#### 2. Programming the Crystal

1. Take the crystal out of the triangle.

2. Using short presses of button A, select a color that corresponds with the planetary energy of your planned operation. Here is a list of the color cycle and possible correspondences:

* white (Moon)
* orange (Mercury)
* green (Venus)
* yellow (Sun)
* red (Mars)
* celestial blue (Jupiter)
* purple (Jupiter)
* indigo (Saturn)
* grey (Saturn)
* off (Saturn)

#### 3a. Audio Frequency Imprinti

1. Plug an audio frequency generator (e.g. your Android phone running the app "Signal Generator") into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a male to male 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack cable. Select a frequency that corresponds with the planetary energy of your planned operation.

2. Press button C to activate the internal amplification circuit. The audio signal is turned into an electromagnetic field radiating out of the clockwise spiral in the center of the triangle. 

3. Use the thumb wheel at the front left of the device to adjust the amplification gain. Turn it to the left (clockwise) for a lesser (down to 20fold) amplification of the signal. Or turn it to the right (counterclockwise) for a stronger (up to 200fold).

4. Place the crystal back into the center of the triangle and immerse it with the selected light and frequencies.

#### 3b. Signal Generator Imprinti

1. Plug a frequency generator such as the Spooky2, PicBerry, FG085 into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a BNC to male 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack adapter cable. Since signal generators usually output a voltage up to 20V, no amplification is needed. DO NOT TURN THE INTERNAL AMPLIFICATION ON.

2. Place the crystal back into the center of the triangle and immerse it with the selected light and frequencies.

#### 3c. Psionic Imprinti

1. Instead of a frequency signal, you may also plug any psionic or radionic device into the into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a proper adapter cable.

2. If the psionic or radionic device outputs and unamplified signal, you may amplify it by a momentary press button C to activate the internal amplification circuit. The radionic signal is radiating out of the clockwise spiral in the center of the triangle. 

3. Use the thumb wheel at the front left of the device to adjust the amplification gain. Turn it to the left (clockwise) for a lesser (down to 20fold) amplification of the signal. Or turn it to the right (counterclockwise) for a stronger (up to 200fold).

4. Place the crystal back into the center of the triangle and immerse it with the selected light and psionic information.

#### 3d. Seal Imprint

1. If you have the Sublunar Psionics Ingress Plate with Universal Lamen cover disk, you can also imprint the crystal with the focused energies of the entity to be conjured.

2. Place a slip of optionally consecrated paper or parchment under the Universal Lamen cover disk and draw the seal onto the paper revealed by the hexagon.

3. Cut out the seal so it fits onto the Ingress Plate without any overlap.

4. Place the Universal Lamen cover disk on top of it so the seal is visible in the center of the hexagram and all pentagrams are facing away from you

5. Connect the Ingress Plate into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a male to male 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack cable.

6. Press button C to activate the internal amplification circuit. The psionic signal coming from the Ingress Plate is turned into an electromagnetic field radiating out of the clockwise spiral in the center of the triangle. 

7. Use the thumb wheel at the front left of the device to adjust the amplification gain. Turn it to the left (clockwise) for a lesser (down to 20fold) amplification of the signal. Or turn it to the right (counterclockwise) for a stronger (up to 200fold).

8. Place the crystal back into the center of the triangle and immerse it with the selected light and psionic imprint of the seal.

#### 4. Ritual Recommendations

Once the priming of the crystal has been finished, the operation can begin. It is recommended but not necessary to turn the color LED and amplification circuits off for the duration of the operation as electromagnetic radiation may interfere with the conjuration.

If you have the Ingress Plate + Universal Lamen with a seal connected to the Psithemius, leave them connected as the energies of the seal will still flow into the Triangle of Manifestation even when unpowered.

If the operation does not follow immediately after programming the crystal, make sure to store the crystal in a dark enclosure out of proximity of embodied living beings.

If something in the ritual goes awry you may press button B at any time as a "kill switch" to immerse the crystal in ultraviolet light and abruptly end the operation. In such a case make sure to also banish ritually.

*CAUTION:*

* The device has three built in 385nm UV-A LEDs that are quite intense (120mW) and can be harmful to eyes and skin.
* Follow the instructions carefully!
* Do Not look directly into UV light. This can be harmful to the human body especially to the eyes and skin, even for brief period due to the intense UV light.
* If viewing the UV light is necessary, please use UV filtered glasses to avoid damage by the UV light.
* Avoid direct eye and skin exposure to the UV light.
* *KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF REACH*.

## Detailed Secondary Operations

### I. Frequency Resonator

1. To immerse yourself in healing sound frequencies, such as the Schumann Resonance of 7.8Hz plug an audio frequency generator (e.g. your Android phone running the app "Signal Generator") into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a male to male 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack cable. Select a desired frequency.

2. Press button C to activate the internal amplification circuit. The audio signal is turned into an electromagnetic field radiating out of the clockwise spiral in the center of the triangle. 

3. Use the thumb wheel at the front left of the device to adjust the amplification gain. Turn it to the left (clockwise) for a lesser (down to 20fold) amplification of the signal. Or turn it to the right (counterclockwise) for a stronger (up to 200fold).

4. Make sure no crystal is placed in the center of the triangle blocking the free flow of the signal into the room.

### II. Amplified Radionic Transmitter

1. If you have an unpowered psionic or radionic device and would like to boost its output signal, plug its output into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a proper adapter cable.

2. Optionally place a single pointed quartz crystal into the center of the triangle for improved amplification. Press button B to initiate a clearing routine of the crystal. Keep away from the UVA light and come back when the UV-LEDs have turned off after 60 seconds.

*CAUTION:*

* The device has three built in 385nm UV-A LEDs that are quite intense (120mW) and can be harmful to eyes and skin.
* Follow the instructions carefully!
* Do Not look directly into UV light. This can be harmful to the human body especially to the eyes and skin, even for brief period due to the intense UV light.
* If viewing the UV light is necessary, please use UV filtered glasses to avoid damage by the UV light.
* Avoid direct eye and skin exposure to the UV light.
* *KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF REACH*.

3. If the connected psionic or radionic device is not grounded to earth, it is recommended to connect a wire to the M2.5 tap hole earth connector located in the middle between the Barrel jack and 3.5mm 1/8" at the rear end of the Psithemius. The other end of the wire should be physically connected to the earth, either by using a wire and a pole or by connecting it to the pipe of a radiator.

4. Press button C to activate the internal amplification circuit. The amplified psionic signal is radiating out of the clockwise spiral in the center of the triangle. 

5. Use the thumb wheel at the front left of the device to adjust the amplification gain. Turn it to the left (clockwise) for a lesser (down to 20fold) amplification of the signal. Or turn it to the right (counterclockwise) for a stronger (up to 200fold).
6. Any rate dialed into the connected psionic or radionic device will transmit into the aether amplified by the Psithemius.

### III. Fluid Condenser Mirror Charger

If you have a Psychurgical Mirror consisting of fluid condenser material, such as the one invented by Lukáš Loužecký and distributed by Czech Hermetics, you are aware that they need to be charged with either sunlight for 5 minutes or ultraviolet light for around an hour prior to a scrying operation. The Psithemius has a special function to achieve that:

1. Press and hold button B for more than a second and trigger the countdown for activating the UV-LEDs.

2. During the countdown carefully place the psychurgic mirror on the Psithemius.

3. After the countdown is over, the UV lights turn and remain on and all buttons are deactivated so they are not accidentally triggered by the psychurgic mirror resting on them.

*CAUTION:*

* The device has three built in 385nm UV-A LEDs that are quite intense (120mW) and can be harmful to eyes and skin.
* Follow the instructions carefully!
* Do Not look directly into UV light. This can be harmful to the human body especially to the eyes and skin, even for brief period due to the intense UV light.
* If viewing the UV light is necessary, please use UV filtered glasses to avoid damage by the UV light.
* Avoid direct eye and skin exposure to the UV light.
* *KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF REACH*.

4. Let the Psithemius radiate UV-light through the fluid condenser for a desired period of time, then turn the Psithemius off using its main power switch at the rear left of the device while avoiding looking into the ultraviolet light

5. Proceed with the scrying operation

### IV. Wishing Machine / Sigil Activator

1. If you have the Sublunar Psionics Ingress Plate, you can use it in combination with the Psithemius as a "wishing machine" or sigil activator.

2. Optionally place a single pointed quartz crystal into the center of the triangle for improved amplification. Press button B to initiate a clearing routine of the crystal. Keep away from the UVA light and come back when the UV-LEDs have turned off after 60 seconds.

*CAUTION:*

* The device has three built in 385nm UV-A LEDs that are quite intense (120mW) and can be harmful to eyes and skin.
* Follow the instructions carefully!
* Do Not look directly into UV light. This can be harmful to the human body especially to the eyes and skin, even for brief period due to the intense UV light.
* If viewing the UV light is necessary, please use UV filtered glasses to avoid damage by the UV light.
* Avoid direct eye and skin exposure to the UV light.
* *KEEP CHILDREN OUT OF REACH*.

3. If your goal(s) correspond with a planetary energy, feel free to choose an appropriate color using momentary presses of button A

4. Alternatively you may also employ the fundamental powers of contingency and randomness to amplify your intent by pressing and holding button A until the LED will flash in random colors.  

5. Place one or more slips of paper with your well formulated or sigilized goal(s) onto the Ingress Plate. Do not use the Universal Lamen cover disk.

6. Connect the Ingress Plate into the 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack at the rear end of the Psithemius using a male to male 3.5mm 1/8" mini jack cable.

7. It is recommended to connect a wire to the M2.5 tap hole earth connector located in the middle between the Barrel jack and 3.5mm 1/8" at the rear end of the Psithemius. The other end of the wire should be physically connected to the earth, either by using a wire and a pole or by connecting it to the pipe of a radiator.

8. Press button C to activate the internal amplification circuit. The psionic signal coming from the Ingress Plate is turned into an electromagnetic field radiating out of the clockwise spiral in the center of the triangle. 

9. Use the thumb wheel at the front left of the device to adjust the amplification gain. Turn it to the left (clockwise) for a lesser (down to 20fold) amplification of the signal. Or turn it to the right (counterclockwise) for a stronger (up to 200fold).

10. Place the crystal back into the center of the triangle and immerse it with the selected light and psionic imprint of the seal.
